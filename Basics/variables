Features of Python
✅ 1. Easy to Learn and Read
Python looks like plain English.
So beginners understand it quickly and write code easily.

✅ 2. Free and Open Source
You don’t have to pay to use Python.
Anyone can download, use, and share it.

✅ 3. Interpreted Language
You don’t need to “compile” your code.
Python runs line-by-line, so it’s easy to test and debug.

✅ 4. Portable

Write code once → run it anywhere
(Windows, Mac, Linux) without changing it.

✅ 5. Object-Oriented
Python supports concepts like:
classes
objects
inheritance
This makes programs cleaner and easier to reuse.

✅ 6. Large Standard Library
Python comes with many built-in modules (like math, file handling, datetime) so you don't always need to install extra packages.

✅ 7. Supports Multiple Programming Styles
You can write code:
in a simple way (procedural)
using functions
using classes (object-oriented)

✅ 8. Huge Community Support
Millions of people use Python.
So you get lots of tutorials, libraries, and help online.

✅ 9. Extensible and Embeddable
You can add code from other languages (C, C++).
You can also use Python inside other applications.

✅ 10. Great for AI, ML, Data Science
Python has famous libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
TensorFlow
PyTorch
Scikit-Learn
